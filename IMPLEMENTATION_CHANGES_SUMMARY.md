## ✅ 4. Fix 'Mi Agenda' Persistence Issues

**Files Modified:** `src/components/employee/EmployeeSchedule.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- **Improved Data Persistence:**
  - Fixed `updateSchedule` function to only update local state after successful database operations
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
  - Removed automatic reversion on errors (allows user to retry)

- **Better Data Loading:**
  - Enhanced `fetchSchedules` with proper try-catch error handling
  - Improved error messages in Spanish
  - More robust handling of database connection issues

- **State Management:**
  - Ensures schedule data persists correctly when navigating between screens

## Database Schema Utilized

The implementation leverages the existing database structure:

```sql
-- Employee Services Junction Table (already existed)
CREATE TABLE public.employee_services (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  employee_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  service_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.services(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(employee_id, service_id)
);
```

## Technical Improvements

1. **Mobile Responsiveness:** All modals now work properly on mobile devices
2. **Error Handling:** Enhanced error handling with user-friendly Spanish messages
3. **Data Integrity:** Proper database transaction handling for personnel assignments
4. **User Experience:** Consistent loading states and visual feedback
5. **Performance:** Optimized data fetching and state management
