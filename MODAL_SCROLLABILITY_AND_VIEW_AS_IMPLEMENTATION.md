# Modal Scrollability & 'View as' Feature Implementation

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Edit Service Modal Scrollability Issue ✅

**Problem**: In the Edit Service modal, after adding an image, the modal exceeded the mobile screen size vertically and was not scrollable, preventing users from accessing the save button.

**Solution**: Modified `src/components/admin/AdminServices.tsx`
- Added `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` classes to the `DialogContent` component
- Added `pb-4` class to the form for proper bottom padding when scrolling

**Changes Made**:
```tsx
// Before
<DialogContent className="max-w-2xl">

// After  
<DialogContent className="max-w-2xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
```

**Result**: The modal is now properly scrollable on mobile devices, ensuring users can always access the save button even when the modal content exceeds the viewport height.

### 2. 'View as' Feature for Admins ✅

**Feature**: Added admin impersonation functionality allowing admins to view the app as if they were signed in as any registered user (employees/clients).

**Implementation**: Modified `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- **User Selection Dropdown**: Admins see a "Ver como" (View as) dropdown in the sidebar
- **User List**: Displays all registered employees and clients with their names and roles
- **Impersonation State**: Visual indicators show when admin is viewing as another user
- **Easy Toggle**: One-click button to return to admin view
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **State Management**:
   ```tsx
   const [impersonatedUser, setImpersonatedUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
   const [availableUsers, setAvailableUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
   const [loadingUsers, setLoadingUsers] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Effective Profile Logic**:
   ```tsx
   const effectiveProfile = impersonatedUser || profile;
   const isImpersonating = impersonatedUser !== null;
   ```

3. **User Fetching**:
   - Automatically fetches all users (except current admin) when admin logs in
   - Orders users by full name for easy selection

4. **UI Components**:
   - **Sidebar Dropdown**: Select component with user list
   - **Header Indicator**: Shows "Viendo como: [Username]" when impersonating
   - **Return Button**: "Volver a vista admin" to exit impersonation mode

5. **Menu Adaptation**:
   - Menu items dynamically change based on effective user role
   - Employees see employee-specific options when impersonated
   - Clients see client-specific options when impersonated

**User Experience**:
- **For Admins**: Easy to test features from different user perspectives
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators of impersonation state
- **Safe Operation**: Original admin permissions preserved
- **Mobile Friendly**: Compact indicators for small screens

**Security Considerations**:
- Only admins can access the 'View as' feature
- Original admin identity is always preserved
- No actual authentication changes - only UI perspective changes
