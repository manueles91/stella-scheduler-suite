# Discount Service Card Refactor Summary

## Overview
Refactored multiple types of discount service cards throughout the application to use a standardized, reusable component. All cards have been updated to have a consistent height (2x the original height) for improved legibility and better visual hierarchy.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Reusable Component
- **File**: `src/components/ui/DiscountServiceCard.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Centralized component for displaying discount services and combos
- **Features**:
  - Three variants: `landing`, `dashboard`, `admin`
  - Unified height system (2x original size)
  - Consistent styling and layout
  - Support for both discounts and combos
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces

### 2. Updated Landing Page
- **File**: `src/components/landing/PromocionesSection.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced custom card implementations with `DiscountServiceCard`
  - Maintained carousel functionality
  - Cards now have height of `h-96` (384px)
  - Improved visual consistency

### 3. Updated Dashboard
- **File**: `src/components/dashboard/DashboardSummary.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced custom promotion cards with `DiscountServiceCard`
  - Cards now have height of `h-48` (192px)
  - Changed layout from vertical list to responsive grid
  - Maintained edit functionality for admins

### 4. Updated Admin Panel
- **File**: `src/components/admin/AdminDiscounts.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced custom discount cards with `DiscountServiceCard`
  - Cards now have height of `h-52` (208px)
  - Changed from single column to responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)
  - Maintained all admin functionality (edit, delete, status display)

### 5. Updated Service Cards
- **File**: `src/components/booking/ServiceCard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to match new height standard (`h-96`)
  - Improved layout with flex positioning
  - Better spacing and visual hierarchy

## Card Heights

| Variant | Height | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Landing | `h-96` (384px) | Promotional carousel on homepage |
| Dashboard | `h-48` (192px) | Quick promotion overview |
| Admin | `h-52` (208px) | Management interface |
| Service | `h-96` (384px) | Booking system |

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All discount service cards now follow the same design patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for card styling and behavior
3. **Improved UX**: Larger cards with better legibility
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces ensure data consistency
5. **Responsive**: Cards adapt to different screen sizes
6. **Modular**: Easy to reuse across different parts of the application
