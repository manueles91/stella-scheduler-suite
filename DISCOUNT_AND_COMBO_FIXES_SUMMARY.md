# Discount and Combo Display Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Individual Services Showing as Combos**

**Problem**: Individual services were incorrectly displaying the "COMBO" badge.

**Root Cause**: The combo detection logic was too broad, showing the combo badge for any item with `type: 'combo'`, even if it only contained a single service.

**Solution**: Updated the combo detection logic to only show the combo badge when:
- `service.type === 'combo'` AND
- `service.combo_services` exists AND
- `service.combo_services.length > 1`

**Files Updated**:
- `src/components/booking/ServiceCard.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/ServicesSection.tsx`
- `src/components/booking/UnifiedBookingSystem.tsx`

### 2. **Discount Percentage Mismatch**

**Problem**: The discount percentage shown in badges didn't match the actual savings calculation.

**Example**: "Julio" service showed "30% OFF" but the actual savings (€45 on €195) was only ~23%.

**Root Cause**: The system was displaying the discount percentage from the database (`discount_value`) instead of calculating the actual percentage based on the final savings.

**Solution**: Implemented a `calculateDiscountPercentage()` function that:
- Calculates the actual discount percentage: `(savings_cents / original_price_cents) * 100`
- Rounds to the nearest whole number
- Uses this calculated percentage instead of the database value

**Files Updated**:
- `src/components/booking/ServiceCard.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/ServicesSection.tsx`
- `src/components/booking/UnifiedBookingSystem.tsx`

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Combo Detection Logic

```typescript
// Before
const isCombo = service.type === 'combo';

// After
const isCombo = service.type === 'combo' && 
                service.combo_services && 
                service.combo_services.length > 1;
```

### New Discount Percentage Calculation

```typescript
const calculateDiscountPercentage = () => {
  if (!hasDiscount || service.original_price_cents === 0) return 0;
  return Math.round((service.savings_cents / service.original_price_cents) * 100);
};

const actualDiscountPercentage = calculateDiscountPercentage();
```

### Updated Badge Display

```typescript
// Before
{service.appliedDiscount?.discount_type === 'percentage' 
  ? `${service.appliedDiscount.discount_value}%` 
  : `${formatPrice(service.appliedDiscount?.discount_value || 0)}`} OFF

// After
{service.appliedDiscount?.discount_type === 'percentage' 
  ? `${actualDiscountPercentage}%` 
  : `${formatPrice(service.appliedDiscount?.discount_value || 0)}`} OFF
```

## Benefits of the Fixes

### 1. **Accurate Visual Indicators**
- Combo badges only appear for actual multi-service combinations
- Individual services are clearly distinguished from combos
- Users can easily identify service types

### 2. **Consistent Pricing Display**
- Discount percentages match actual savings
- No confusion between advertised and actual discounts
- Transparent pricing information

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- Clear distinction between service types
- Accurate discount information builds trust
- Consistent display across all components

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Combo Detection Testing**
- Verify combo badges only appear for services with multiple items
- Test individual services to ensure no combo badges appear
- Check edge cases with single-service combos

### 2. **Discount Calculation Testing**
- Test percentage discounts with various values
- Verify calculated percentages match actual savings
- Test edge cases with zero prices or zero savings

### 3. **Cross-Component Consistency**
- Ensure all components (ServiceCard, ServicesSection, UnifiedBookingSystem) use the same logic
- Test discount display in booking flow
- Verify consistency between landing page and booking system

## Future Considerations

### 1. **Database Schema**
- Consider adding a `calculated_discount_percentage` field to the database
- This would eliminate the need for client-side calculation
- Ensure data consistency across all systems

### 2. **Combo Definition**
- Consider adding a `minimum_services` field to combos
- This would make combo detection more explicit
- Allow for single-service "combos" if needed

### 3. **Discount Validation**
- Add server-side validation to ensure discount calculations are correct
- Implement unit tests for discount calculations
- Add monitoring for discount calculation discrepancies

## Conclusion

These fixes ensure that:
- ✅ Individual services no longer show combo badges
- ✅ Discount percentages accurately reflect actual savings
- ✅ Visual indicators are consistent and trustworthy
- ✅ User experience is improved with accurate information

The system now provides clear, accurate, and consistent information about service types and pricing, building user trust and improving the overall booking experience.
