## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql

ALTER TABLE public.reservations 
ADD COLUMN applied_discount_id UUID REFERENCES public.discounts(id),
ADD COLUMN original_price_cents INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN final_price_cents INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN savings_cents INTEGER;

-- Create combo duration calculation function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_combo_duration(combo_id UUID)
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
  total_duration INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
  SELECT COALESCE(SUM(s.duration_minutes * cs.quantity), 0)
  INTO total_duration
  FROM combo_services cs
  JOIN services s ON cs.service_id = s.id
  WHERE cs.combo_id = $1;
  
  RETURN total_duration;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
