## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
DayCalendarView/
├── Header (Date navigation)
├── Week Navigation Bar
├── Time Grid
│   ├── Time Labels (6:00-22:00)
│   ├── Time Slots (clickable areas)
│   └── Event Overlays
├── Floating Action Buttons
└── Modal Dialogs
    ├── New Appointment Form
    └── Block Time Form

- `MINUTE_HEIGHT = 1` pixel per minute
- Time range: 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM (16 hours)

### Event Positioning Algorithm
Events are positioned absolutely based on their start time and duration:
- **Top Position**: `(startHour - 6) * HOUR_HEIGHT + (startMinute * MINUTE_HEIGHT)`
- **Height**: `duration * MINUTE_HEIGHT`
- **Z-index**: 10 to overlay time grid

### Data Integration
- Fetches appointments from `reservations` table
