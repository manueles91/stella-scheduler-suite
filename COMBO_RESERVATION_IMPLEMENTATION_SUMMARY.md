# Enhanced Combo Reservation System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented an enhanced single reservation system for combos that provides flexibility for salons while maintaining ease of use for customers and proper time management for employees.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Single Combo Reservations**
- **Before**: Created multiple individual reservations for each service in a combo
- **After**: Creates one main reservation with detailed service tracking
- **Benefits**: 
  - Single booking experience for customers
  - Clear time block management
  - No double-booking issues
  - Easier admin management

### 2. **Flexible Employee Assignment**
- **Primary Employee**: Assigned to the entire combo (customer selects during booking)
- **Service-Specific Employees**: Can be assigned per service by admins/employees
- **Auto-Assignment**: System suggests optimal employee combinations based on availability

### 3. **Smart Time Slot Management**
- **Combo Duration**: Calculates total time needed for all services
- **Employee Eligibility**: Only shows employees who can perform ALL services in the combo
- **Conflict Prevention**: Blocks entire time slot to prevent double-booking
- **Flexible Execution**: Services can be performed in any order within the time block

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created

#### `combo_reservations`
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- client_id: UUID (References profiles)
- guest_user_id: UUID (References invited_users)
- combo_id: UUID (References combos)
- primary_employee_id: UUID (References profiles)
- appointment_date: DATE
- start_time: TIME
- end_time: TIME (Total combo duration)
- status: TEXT (confirmed, cancelled, completed, no_show, in_progress)
- notes: TEXT
- final_price_cents: INTEGER
- original_price_cents: INTEGER
- savings_cents: INTEGER
- is_guest_booking: BOOLEAN
- customer_email: TEXT
- customer_name: TEXT
```

#### `combo_service_assignments`
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- combo_reservation_id: UUID (References combo_reservations)
- service_id: UUID (References services)
- assigned_employee_id: UUID (References profiles, nullable)
- estimated_start_time: TIME (Estimated time within combo block)
- estimated_duration: INTEGER (Duration in minutes)
- actual_start_time: TIME (Actual start time when service begins)
- actual_end_time: TIME (Actual end time when service completes)
- status: TEXT (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- notes: TEXT
```

### Automatic Triggers
- **Service Assignment Creation**: Automatically creates service assignments when combo reservation is created
- **Timing Updates**: Automatically updates combo end time when service assignments change

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Booking Flow Updates**

#### Customer Experience
- Select combo from available options
- Choose preferred primary employee (if multiple eligible)
- Select available time slot (based on primary employee availability)
- Single confirmation for entire combo

#### Admin/Employee Management
- View combo reservations with service breakdown
- Assign specific employees to individual services
- Track service progress and completion
- Manage employee workloads efficiently

### 2. **Time Slot Generation Logic**

#### For Individual Services
- Standard time slot generation based on service duration
- Employee availability and schedule conflicts checked
- 30-minute slot intervals

#### For Combos
- **Employee Eligibility**: Only employees who can perform ALL services in combo
- **Duration Calculation**: Sum of all service durations (with quantities)
- **Conflict Prevention**: Blocks entire time block for combo duration
- **Availability Check**: Considers both individual reservations and combo reservations

### 3. **Employee Assignment Strategy**

#### Primary Employee (Customer Selection)
- **Auto-Assignment**: Primary employee assigned to primary service
- **Time Block**: Entire combo time blocked for primary employee
- **Responsibility**: Accountable for overall combo execution

#### Secondary Services (Admin Assignment)
- **Single Eligible Employee**: Auto-assigned automatically
- **Multiple Eligible Employees**: No time blocking until admin assigns
- **Flexibility**: Admins can optimize employee utilization

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Customer Books Combo**

3. Customer selects preferred employee (Maria)
4. System shows available time slots for Maria (considering combo duration)
5. Customer selects 10:00 AM slot

7. Maria's time is blocked for entire combo duration
```

### 2. **Admin Assigns Service Employees**
```
1. Admin opens combo reservation details
2. System shows all services in combo with current assignments
3. Admin assigns Maria to Facial (primary service - already assigned)
4. Admin assigns Juan to Manicure (specialized in nail services)
5. Admin assigns Ana to Pedicure (specialized in foot care)
6. System updates service assignments
7. Employees see their specific service assignments
```

### 3. **Service Execution**
```
1. Maria starts Facial at 10:00 AM (primary service)
2. Juan can start Manicure anytime after 10:45 AM (estimated)
3. Ana can start Pedicure anytime after 11:15 AM (estimated)
4. Each employee updates their service status
5. System tracks overall combo progress
6. Combo marked complete when all services finished
```
