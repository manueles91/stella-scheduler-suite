# Combo Bookings Admin Dashboard Fix

## Problem Identified
After implementing the new combo reservation system, combo bookings were not appearing in several admin dashboard pages:
- **Ingresos** (Revenue/Income page)
- **Inicio** (Dashboard Overview)  
- **Mi Agenda** (Employee Calendar)

## Root Cause
The admin dashboard components were only fetching data from the `admin_reservations_view`, which only included individual service reservations from the `reservations` table. The new `combo_reservations` table was completely separate and not included in any admin views.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Database Views**
Created migration `20250128000007-update-admin-views-for-combos.sql` that:

- **Updates `admin_reservations_view`**: Now includes both individual service reservations AND combo reservations
- **Updates `employee_calendar_view`**: Now includes combo bookings for employees
- **Adds new fields**: `booking_type`, `combo_id`, `combo_name` to distinguish between service and combo bookings

### 2. **Enhanced Admin Dashboard Components**

#### **AdminIngresos.tsx**
- Updated interface to include combo fields
- Enhanced display logic to show combo bookings with visual indicators
- Added "COMBO" badges and "Combo completo" labels
- Combo bookings now appear in revenue calculations and graphs

#### **DashboardSummary.tsx** 
- Updated to fetch combo data from enhanced view
- Added combo information to appointment objects
- Combo bookings now appear in upcoming/past appointments lists

#### **TimeTracking.tsx (Mi Agenda)**
- Updated to use `employee_calendar_view` instead of direct table queries
- Added combo visual indicators (purple color, COMBO badges)
- Combo bookings now appear in employee calendar view

#### **AppointmentCard.tsx**
- Enhanced to display combo indicators
- Shows "COMBO" badges for combo bookings
- Maintains consistent display across all components

### 3. **Data Structure Changes**

#### **New Fields Added**
```typescript
interface ReservationLite {
  // ... existing fields
  booking_type?: 'service' | 'combo';
  combo_id?: string | null;
  combo_name?: string | null;
}

interface Appointment {
  // ... existing fields
  isCombo?: boolean;
  comboId?: string | null;
  comboName?: string | null;
}
```

#### **View Structure**
The updated `admin_reservations_view` now uses a UNION to combine:
- **Individual reservations**: From `reservations` table
- **Combo reservations**: From `combo_reservations` table with calculated durations

### 4. **Visual Enhancements**

#### **Combo Indicators**
- **Blue "COMBO" badges** in admin lists
- **Purple calendar blocks** for combo bookings in employee view
- **"Combo completo" labels** in revenue displays
- **Enhanced service names** showing combo information

#### **Consistent Styling**
- Combo bookings use distinct colors and badges
- Maintains existing design language
- Clear visual distinction between service and combo bookings
