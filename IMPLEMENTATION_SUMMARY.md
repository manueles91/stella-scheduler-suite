## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
- **Integrated Solution**: Added to existing TimeTracking component
- **State Management**: 
  - `viewMode`: Toggle between 'list' and 'calendar'
  - `weekDays`: Array of current week dates
  - `dialogType`: Track appointment vs block dialog
  - `appointmentForm`: Form state for new appointments
- **Conditional Rendering**: Different UI based on view mode

### Event Positioning Algorithm
```typescript
const calculateEventStyle = (startTime: string, endTime: string) => {
  const start = parseISO(`2000-01-01T${startTime}`);
  const end = parseISO(`2000-01-01T${endTime}`);
  const duration = differenceInMinutes(end, start);
  
  const startHour = start.getHours();
  const startMinute = start.getMinutes();
  const top = (startHour - 6) * HOUR_HEIGHT + (startMinute * MINUTE_HEIGHT);
  const height = duration * MINUTE_HEIGHT;
  
  return {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: `${top}px`,
    height: `${height}px`,
    left: '0px',
    right: '8px',
    zIndex: 10,
  };
};
```

### Key Functions Added
- `updateWeekDays()`: Generate current week dates
- `navigateDate()`: Navigate between days
- `openDialog()`: Open appointment/block dialogs with pre-filled data
- `createAppointment()`: Create new appointments via admin interface
- `calculateEventStyle()`: Position events based on time
- `renderTimeSlots()`: Generate clickable time grid
- `renderCalendarView()`: Main calendar view renderer

## Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Design
- **Full Screen**: Calendar view uses full viewport height
- **Touch Targets**: Large buttons and clickable areas
- **Scrollable**: Vertical scrolling for time periods
- **Floating Actions**: Positioned for easy thumb access

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Week Navigation**: Horizontal scrolling week bar
- **Touch-Friendly**: All interactive elements sized appropriately
- **Condensed Information**: Optimized for mobile screens

## User Experience Enhancements

### Visual Feedback
- **Loading States**: Spinner while fetching data
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive feedback on all clickable elements
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between event types
- **Today Highlighting**: Special badge for current day

### Intuitive Navigation
- **Context Awareness**: Always shows current position in week/month
- **Quick Actions**: Fast access to common tasks
- **Pre-filled Forms**: Time slots auto-populate form fields
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information organization

## Integration with Existing System

### Database Integration
- **Existing Tables**: Uses current `reservations` and `blocked_times` tables
- **Real-time Updates**: Fetches fresh data on date changes
- **Supabase Integration**: Maintains existing database patterns

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Profile Context**: Uses existing `useAuth` hook
- **Role-based Access**: Maintains existing permission system
